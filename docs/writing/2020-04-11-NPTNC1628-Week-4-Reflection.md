***NPTNC1628: Week 3 Memory***

When I am working on projects in my workshops with students I frequently say to them that 80% of my job is just pattern recognition. Students sometimes are amazed with my flexibility and swift feedback with regards to tool usage, project direction, etc. I previously thought that this is because I've seen the same thing and done the same thing many times, which is partially true. What engaged me was when Ormrod begins to link expertise with tightly organized knowledge, with many interrelationships between the knowledge, while there are generalizations unifying details(Ch. 8, p. 278). I am an expert in my content area because I have built up a large, tightly woven knowledge bank over the years, and I still have a large interest in the topic. So it's a bit more than pattern recognition!
