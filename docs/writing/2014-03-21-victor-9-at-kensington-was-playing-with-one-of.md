<p>Victor, 9, at kensington was playing with one of my prototypes. He found some LEDs and began powering them by shorting the traces. He seems really interested in this project, especially after blowing up an LED and seeing how shorting the circuit in a specific way shuts down the MacBook we were working on.</p>
