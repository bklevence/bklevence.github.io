This past week working on our<a href="http://connected.ecrafting.org/walls/7/"> Connected Messages mural</a> I could sense that the leaving the theme topics a bit too open ended lead to more [adult] intervention in each kids work than I would like.
Our first day working on our mural we documented some of the kids running stories that play the line between humor, fantasy, and real life. However, after having a a mock viewing and eulogies for Uncle(and exhausting our inside jokes) it was hard to get motivated to create more or begin to delve into more serious topics.

This was all cleared up after diverting our attention to our <a href="https://bk.makes.org/thimble/remix-of-magnetic-makey-makey-mazes">Makey Makey contest entry</a> for some fun and unintended inspiration. After trying to make some badges that one would “unlock” for completing our Group How-To(thank you <a title="View the profile of techkim" href="http://www.makeymakey.com/forums/index.php?PHPSESSID=s939hkik15mom67h3bfvursj97&amp;action=profile;u=1733">techkim</a>) we realized that we could use the badge sketching templates as a means of expressing ourselves on our mural. We unintentionally created a way to make patterns, display things we like, and even create our own achievement badges for what we have learned(something I have wanted to do since the start of this summer). It’s truly an awesome way for the kids to get work onto paper and who-knows we may scale and copy these bad boys to hand out at the Maker Celebration!
