Mr. Foldesy, my High School art teacher was one of the best. Mr. Foldesy seemed like a laid back art teacher, but his design courses were engaging to all. He instilled a sense of rigor in us by requiring varied experimentation both in class assignments and homework in sketchbooks. Looking back on the class he was able to get everyone focused and at the same time individually address our concerns, areas of improvement, or frustrations during individual critiques. He would treat our sketchbooks as a place for individual student and teacher conversation. Out of some of these conversations he would make connections between students as a groups. He would relate the purpose of group critiques to each students future occupational goals or interests. Mr. Foldesy was a true teaching professional in his intertwining of our interests and backgrounds into the content, discussions, and activities in his class.
