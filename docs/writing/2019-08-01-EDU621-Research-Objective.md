**A5a Research Objective**

 My research objective is to “identify the effect documentation of project material usage has on 9th grade technology classes”. In order to complete this objective I will interview four teachers and a supervisor at A1 Regional High School District (a pseudonym) in a suburban town in New Jersey. One of the teachers is Ms. A.(all names are pseudonyms) a 9th-12th grade Engineering and Technology teacher with fifteen years of experience. The other teacher is Ms. B. who teachers 9th grade technology classes and has three years experience. I will also interview Mr. C who is a 9th-12th grade woodshop instructor and has fifteen years of experience. The last teacher I will interview is Mr. D., a 10th-12th grade technology instructor, who has 40 years experience as a teacher and supervisor and helped write technology standards for NJ in the mid 1990s. And finally I will interview Mr. E. who is the Technology Department Supervisor for A1 Regional and has 15 years of experience in schools, 8 of them in a supervisory role. My initial reasoning for interviewing the teachers is to begin to generate a narrative for how they may or may not integrate student reflection on material usage into their projects. I will also be utilizing these connections in the classroom to observe and collect data on material usage and conscientious student thought on sustainable prototyping.  I am interviewing Mr. D and Mr. E. to begin to understand how material consumption has been viewed at a supervisory role and to understand any outside influence on material consumption in classes.

**A5b Protocols**

**Interview Protocol for Classroom Teachers**

* Can you summarize your professional experiences and your primary job responsibilities?
* Briefly summarize how sustainability relates to the Technology Department.
* Do you put a limit on consumable materials for your student projects? How so?
* When the students are heavily into prototyping, does that limit change? How?
* How do you believe material constraints affect student performance? Please explain.
* As a teacher, how do you manage materials within the class or project?
* Do you engage your students in work to think about their material consumption in class?
* Do your students calculate how much material they use in a project? If so, how?
* Have you ever run a project that had a focus on material constraints or sustainability? Expand please.
* How do you define waste or scrap?
* What do you do with your waste material?
* What project do you see as the most wasteful?
* How do you deal with students wasting materials?
* Have standards or curriculum ever driven material constraints or sustainable usage of material in your projects? Expand.  
* Do you reduce, reuse, or recycle at home, what and how?
* Do you have a project related to sustainability that you’d like to implement?

**Interview Protocol for Technology Supervisor**

* Can you summarize your professional experiences and your primary job responsibilities?
* Briefly summarize how sustainability relates to the Technology Department.
* How is a materials budget established for the Technology Department?
* How do you budget materials for each teacher in the department? How do you differentiate?
* How do you believe material constraints affect student performance? Please explain.
* Have you ever implemented any sustainable design units with focus on materials? Why or why not?
* Do you engage in conversation with the department focusing on material usage?
* Has the Technology department ever made a conscious effort to recycle or reuse scrap or waste materials in a project?
* What happens with waste material from the Technology Department?
* Do you keep track of material usage from year to year? How and where?
* How do you define waste or scrap?
* How do you deal with students wasting materials?
* Have standards or curriculum ever driven material constraints or sustainable usage of material in your projects? Expand.  
* Do you know of any other schools that recycle their materials? How do they do it?
* Would you consider pushing teachers and students to recycle material and scrap? How so?
* Would you consider pushing teachers and students to reduce the amount of materials the use in projects? How so?

Extra tool 1: Weighing the scrap buckets or sorting and weighing scrap materials from each class at the end of each day during projects.

Extra tool 2: Have students submit their files for digital fabrication via a form so that we can document the estimated material consumption for each print, as well as iteration number, and basic usage statistics for each student, class, and project.
