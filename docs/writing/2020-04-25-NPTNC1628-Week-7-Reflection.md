***NPTNC1628: Week 7 Recap***

I really enjoyed thinking about my current unit project and all the units leading up to it through the lens of Vygotsky's Zones of Proximal Development. It allowed me to better focus on frustration points in my content for students and how to best manage my planning. This allowed me to then assess and set expectations for student behavior when working through various problems. I could then backtrack and better note how to modify my learning sequences within my units for next year. This class has helped me reflect more on my courses.   ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
