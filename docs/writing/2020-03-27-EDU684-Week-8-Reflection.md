***EDU684 Week 8 Literature Review Sharing***






For my literature review I focused on Special Education. In particular I tried to understand how Special Education classrooms have changed over time, understand generally how CTE programs have viewed Special Education, and one method of inclusion and access using Universal Design for Learning and technology within the classroom and curricula. The first thing that stood out to me was that all of my articles were asking for more time(PD hours, planning time, or PLC) for teachers to learn about methods for better servicing and including all students within their content area. The second fact was not surprising, but interesting is how synonymous inclusion is with multicultural education. I was left with bigger questions about various programs my school district runs for students with severe learning needs (autism, cerebral palsy, downs syndrome) and how I could better serve those students both socially and within my content area.
