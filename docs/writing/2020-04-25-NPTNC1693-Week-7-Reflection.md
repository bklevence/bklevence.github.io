***NPTNC1628: Week 7 Gradebook***

I have what I think is a pretty straight forward gradebook. My course units are projects which can be broken into smaller assignments. I utilize those assignments and our common assessment rubric to give each of them a 5-10 pt grade as outlined by our department rubric. Students traditionally must keep track of my rolling due dates via check-ins in class and how I change those dates on our LMS. Some things students must hand in on our LMS, etc. For grading I generally am lenient on late points being taken off, and try my best to allow students accommodations if something is going on and put on my radar. This year I have gotten better at giving students poor grades with a comment saying the previous statement. This gets them, their parents, and their support teams all able to tell what's going on in real time. It also in some cases either sparks a conversation that is needed or work hand-in that may have just been forgotten. 

My department has talked about our freshman foundations course potentially going without any grades in the future, maybe for a unit or two as a trial. Some are concerned students will not do any work, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Personally I worked on alternate credentialing projects implementing digital badges as well as informal project based gradebooks prior to teaching so I'm aligned with few-to-no grades with a focus on craftsmanship and soft skills.
