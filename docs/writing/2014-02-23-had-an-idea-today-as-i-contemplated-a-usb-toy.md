<p>Had an idea today as I contemplated a USB toy business-card. One of the larger costs is the usb cable, which up to this point I&rsquo;ve been able to scrap old broken cables that I collect.</p>
<p>I have two options, one is to buy a female usb adaptor(~$.20) which can be soldered into the circuit. The other option is to design a male usb plug into the circuit (and use a thicker substrate than paper). Just an idea! I wanted to get it out on paper, image/sketch coming later.</p>
