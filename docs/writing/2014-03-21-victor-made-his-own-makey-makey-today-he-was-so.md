<p>Victor made his own MaKey MaKey today. He was so stoked about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to go home and break my computer!&rdquo; &ldquo;Can we make another? &hellip;I ant to help other kids make them! Even at school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Victor hacked his makey with an LED. I think this grew out of him playing with my initial prototypes blowing up LEDs etc. This then funneled into a Minecraft day that Sa-De was running in the computer lab after hours.</p>
<p>One issue I ran into was him bridging a few of the traces with solder as you can see next to his piny in the hands picture. Also the timing is a little bit off on the hardware. In a video I&rsquo;ll post later you can see how the sensing of the circuit is either off or not working here and there.(hope to get this fixed soon)</p>
