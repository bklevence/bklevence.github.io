Ever since I stepped into the woodshop in college I have been interested in teaching. The exchange of skills, ideas, and critique in design studios were eye opening after years in traditional classrooms. My experiences both in and out of the classroom after college have led me to enjoy the connections I make with students. Guiding or assisting them from an idea, through a design process, and to a finished product is what I can geek out over.

I feel as though my willingness to learn new things, be open to others ideas, and to listen will help me in becoming a better teacher. I am open to critique, am motivated to see students learn new skills, and driven to collaborate on many levels.
