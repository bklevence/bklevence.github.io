<p>I had to get Windows and install AtmelStudio 6 to work on recompiling a .hex for the Attiny85. After a bit of <a href="http://www.avr-tutorials.com/avr-studio-6/generating-hex-file-avr-studio-6">research</a> and tinkering it worked. It&rsquo;s definitely a little overbearing to show the kids, but introducing them to how keys work via <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AujpLIx1UiIjdDNvQzhhcGhkQ1MxSElZV1Z5THRMMWc&amp;output=html">this sheet</a> could be a possibility. Really stoked that I now have full control over programming keys.</p>
