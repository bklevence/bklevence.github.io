    text: "The CNC router is a milling machine outfitted with motors that precisely control each axis (CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control). It is a subtractive process which uses a moving spinning bit or cutter to cut through material. The bits of the router can be switched out; we have a range of bits. Material can be cut along two or three dimensions. This one just happens to cut smaller stuff and is really good at milling FR-4"

- [ ] Find Youtube Videos for machine setup/post
- [ ] Find proper Eagle settings for sizing for soldering
- [ ] How to clamps wood, metal?
- [ ] Get links and docs from bantam site.
- [ ] Whats the procedure for proper sizing to then export. any libraries?

I have a hyperlinked doc on how to go from EasyEDA to the bantam that I need to upload. Eagle still works, but is harder to keep properly updated on student laptops. I also really need to get on with learning KiCAD.........
