    text: "The CNC router is a milling machine outfitted with motors that precisely control each axis (CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control). It is a subtractive process which uses a moving spinning bit or cutter to cut through material. The bits of the router can be switched out; we have a range of bits. Material can be cut along two or three dimensions. This one just happens to cut smaller stuff and is really good at milling FR-4"
