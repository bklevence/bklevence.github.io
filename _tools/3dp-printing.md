## FormLabs 2?
Super interesting printer, not student friendly. I spent 2 months servicing one that a student almost broke the year before I got to NVD. Definitely get a good UV box or clean sunny space.

## Monoprice Maker Mini V2

Decent printer that I use at home directly off my PC with CURA. May set up Octoprint once I have a good location for the printer.

## Monoprice Maker Select

Run away from these fire-hazards. Even after fixing the thermistor...

## Makerbot

### Replicator
Solid machine, likes loose extrusion, hard to keep consistent temp. Once it gets gremlins they stay.

### Replicator 2
Horrible machine, all I have interacted with have had ribbon cable gremlins. Run away.

### Replicator 2X
Really decent when they work. Can be very temper-mental. Does two materials well.

## Materials Review

- NGEN is great, but fractures, super shiny.
- PLA, good-old standard. Watch for moisture and dust.
- ABS, only for enclosed dimension, very susceptible to moisture damage.
- Ninjaflex, only used once. Can't use at home.
- TPU, want to try.
