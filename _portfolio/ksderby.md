I have a fun track record of helping youth make entries for the Kensington Kinetic Sculpture Derby. I have done it three years now and have gone from a closet of junk bikes, a to sponsored franken-tandem, and finally students fundraised to strip down pick-up to make it human powered. Not much more to explain, the projects have gotten a fair amount of press:
