    text: "I had the most extreme pleasure of working with students at The Workshop School in West Philadelphia from 2016-2018. I did IT work, facilitated workshops in classes, wrangled the tools in various shops, and ran a program called Workshop Industries."

## Notable Collaborations or Clients:
Philadelphia Water Works, Bartram's Garden, The Bike Church, Kensington Kinetic Sculpture Derby, Little Baby's Ice Cream, UPenn, Drexel, Saxby's Coffee, The Philadelphia School District, 52nd St Business District, West Philadelphia Catholic, the Federal Reserve, Lea Elementary School, and many more.

## Products
As the directing mentor of Workshop Industries I helped bring to life multiple products utilizing the Workshop's digital fabrication tools such as:
The Jawnament, Giant Scrabble Tiles & Holders, Love & Noel Designs, Generative Spiderwebs and Snowflakes, and last but not least The Jawnorah. All of these products were designed with and machined by students after school or during internship hours throughout the week. They sold these products at craft fairs or online and in my last year students net $16,000 profit during Holiday Sales.
