9th Grade students are tasked to build a Siege Machine as their first project following the Engineering Design Process. They research, brainstorm, prototype, test with standard marshmallows, fix or refine, and finally battle it out while collecting data.

Students during the 2018-2019 school year documented their Siege Machines in A5 booklets.
