<p>A thought occurred to me, so far I have only been working with one key input . This has allowed for my circuit to remain simple as there is only the need for one “sensing input”. I am worried that if I add multiple inputs without moving onto another microcontroller I will undoubtedly make the circuit far more complex.</p>
<p>This may drive me to consider focusing on simplified units to deploy as my first iteration. These simple versions will only have one of the following inputs: space bar, w, a, s, d, arrow keys. It will be an initial attempt to keep the cost low as I source another microcontroller to make the unit more integrated and simplified while adding more features.</p>
