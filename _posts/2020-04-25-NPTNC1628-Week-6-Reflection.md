***NPTNC1628: Week 6 Socio Cultural Theory***

In my shops I feel like I am almost scaffolding the entire year as our units quickly build off of their exercises and eventually each-other. In fact, I find it very hard to quickly adapt and include students who miss a few weeks or are very late additions to my courses. Similarly I have a couple students who have struggled with adapting to high school [in my 9th grade] this year. I have found giving them a clean slate and re-evaluating what they really need to learn within the current projects context is needed.

This takes extra work on my end, and a fair amount of additional differentiation, but finding ways to meet them at their level and chunk up the current project towards an individualized learning goal is needed to keep them engaged and not in over their heads. Typically I design agency and reach goals into each project or unit, but I have found now I need to re-evaluate entry points for each unit to make atypical student entry or engagement smoother and more accessible.
