<p>This sort of collaboration was awesome to see. </p>
<p>Shanaya(12), Brandon(9), and Judas(14) worked in a team to hold the soldering iron, the solder, and consult the computer for where the components were goin to go as they pre-<span>soldered</span> or &ldquo;tinned&rdquo; the circuit. The splitting of tasks allowed for people to join in when they felt interested and also allowed for all to feel as though they&rsquo;d hat a part in the collective effort. (its a shame she took her glasses off in this picture!</p>
