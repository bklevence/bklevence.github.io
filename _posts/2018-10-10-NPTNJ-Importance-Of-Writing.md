Although heavily dependent on visual communication my discipline requires one to be comfortable and confident with their writing. One must be able to communicate both in correspondence as well as when they are not present to tell a story about their work. Similarly design presentations and lectures require one to engage their audience by telling a story with limited reliance on text. When outside of the traditional design profession and in the realm of computer science good use of writing is a required skill. One must be able to clearly document or simply comment out their code so they can come back to it and walk through it on their own. Programmers commenting code and writing documentation for projects allows them to share ideas, methods, and allow for dialogue leading to better code and projects. In my experience good documentation has allowed for people across the globe to find bugs in the hardware I've designed as well as tinker further with my ideas.
