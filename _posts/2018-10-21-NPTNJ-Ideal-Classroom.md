My ideal classroom is a room with four clearly defined zones. The first is for storage student bags, projects, and a locked area for materials. This is ideally the entrance to the space as Iâ€™ve seen in my current school. The second zone is a working area with taller wooden work tables and stools. In this space instruction, lecture, work, and critique can happen. The third and fourth zones are machine and specialized workbench areas. Ideally you have a shop for different types of tooling, but in most cases you can only work in one room.  In the third and fourth zones I would expect a few saws, hand tools, sanders, and different woodshop tools, and alongside them digital and electronic manufacturing devices. Safety procedures and personal safety equipment are easily noted around the space, and the sections with dangerous tools are easy to monitor and walk through as seen in many local college woodshops.
