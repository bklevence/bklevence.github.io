As most of my classrooms have been project based I have found cycling through my methods of instruction to be most beneficial. Throughout a project I will lecture and give individual instruction via desk check-ins. I find this as useful to digital tools as it is with physical tools of creation. Learners need an extra set of eyes and a guiding hand to begin to gain proficiency. Working with technology can be intimidating to some and simple to others mixing up my ways of interacting with students allows me to guide their learning in the moment. I find it benefits student project outcomes and the working culture of a studio when an educator helps push the work as it is happening over critiquing in progress or finished work.
