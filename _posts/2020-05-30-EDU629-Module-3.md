***EDU629: Module 3 Journal***



For modules 3, 6, and 9, you will provide a journal entry.  The entry is only visible to the course instructor.  The journal provides a space for you to consider the assigned readings and the contents of the modules in relation to your experiences as a student, and how these experiences (in reference to the course) can inform your work as a teacher.  

Each entry should be between 550-650 words.  For each entry, reflect on your experiences as a student in relation to the module content and the readings.  What are you reminded of?  How might past schooling experiences differed if you instructors attended to the content in the modules and readings?  What are your hopes for yourself as a teacher in implementing and adopting the module content and readings?  

Each entry will be worth 3 points.  Cumulatively, the journal is worth 9 points.
