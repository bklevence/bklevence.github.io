***EDU616 Week 6 Formative Assessment***

I do well on tests with moderate preparation, and looking back on high school years I struggled with oral tests in high-school in language and latin classes. I remember in chemistry having to go to the board to balance equations and I hated every minute of it. So looking back on my schooling I struggled with "on-the-spot" and whole class facing forms of assessment. However, I was generally okay at giving presentations and doing critiques in my art classes.

I utilize many exit tickets as well as weekly check-points on design documents with my students to keep track of their work and assess how they're doing. The grading on these types of checks or assessments is very flexible and can be updated within a certain amount of time depending on the class, project, and unit progression.
