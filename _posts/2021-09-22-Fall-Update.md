***Fall Update***

My surgery was mostly a success, I am no longer in constant pain, my hand is still not 100% back to strength, but I am very happy with my results so far. It ended up being a cyst. Very thankful!  

I have taken a long break from updating things, but will resume at some point. This website still needs a minor refresh, but I am content with just adding more content to it over time. I spent my time fishing, learning to shuck oysters, and learning to paddle board this summer. 

I am currently in the process of getting my CTE Engineering certification, doing a lot of upkeep at work on our machines, and generally trying to stay organized both professionally and at home. Lots of bigger updates have happened to Onshape/Figma and other tools over the summer, tons of nice quality of life things to find upon returning to the classroom fulltime at 100%. 

In the near future I hope to have an update about [my great grandfathers submarine school journals](https://twitter.com/senorklev/status/1381653472324558853?s=21). I may have just found them a permanent home! As well as gotten some more interesting backstory about the journals. 

My flickr account jumped from 20k photos to 30k photos this summer. Support gave me the email equivalent of a shrug as they have no feature to detect dupes and their auto-upldr messed up. I ended up downloading all images last weekend, used Auslogics Duplicate File Finder to remove dupes from that download, then installed iCloud on my windows machine and had the software remove dups from the download that already existed in iCloud. Over the course of this week I have been using Last Photo on iOS to batch correct metadata(specifically dates). I hope to at some point do a quick update for geolocation metadata so iCloud can do its memories thing. In addition to this, I may nuke my flickr account and start over, or just begin storing a backup of my iCloud on physical remote media occasionally. It's been a fun walk down memory lane. 

I have also just started playing a really fun game called Wyldermyth, I am about to finish the second book in the expanse series, finally I am watching the MCU movies in the "right sequence" and so far Guardians is my favorite franchise closely followed by Avengers...

Currently wondering how often I should update this blog. A digest each season change sounds kinda fun!
