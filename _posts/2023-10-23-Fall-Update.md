***Fall '23 Update***

I've made it through most of 2023 without an update! So here are the facts: 

- We had a kid in July.
- Thankfully I never ended up with lymes, I did find out I'm quite allergic to dust, pollen, and mold, so I'm better off living isolated with an unlimited supply of HEPA filters. 
- I've been on leave from work, a nice reset, and it's been really nice to be with family. 
- I've been tinkering around with trying to program discord bots a little bit. Fun stuff with home automation. I've also been on a grind to get my content digitally backed up, my physical books got a little mouldy in storage and I had to throw out a lot of my posessions this summer...
- The last book I read prior to the child unit coming into the world was The Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin. I am looking forward to reading the other two in the series soon. I got into the authors work by picking up a book of their short stories while visting Chicago.
- We recently fell in love with Chicago having visited 4 times in the last year. I will have to update a travel page specifically for Chicago recs, and we'd love to move there someday. 
- Late to bed lately thanks to the kiddo, and playing a good amount of late night Baldur's Gate 3 as it's all my brain can semi-process at 2AM. I've also been playing Dwarf Fortress on the steamdeck, it's absoutely mindblowing how much tech has changed in the last decade. I'm really eyeing up a framework laptop down the road. 
- I did the ARRL TI 2 workshop in July and was able to get a lot of the SDR stuff working on the steamdeck. It's amazing how much you can get done even without full perms on the OS.
    - My crystal radio curriculum will hopefully make it onto their learning portal at some point. 
- I brewed my first IPA in May-June. A Coconut Milkshake IPA, it tasted of pineapple mostly, and was great at the baby shower. Unfortunately my Berliner Weisse was overactive and all that didn't get consumed at the party turned to bottle bombs. Finally, my homebrew has made it on to [untapped](https://untappd.com/winkingdogbrew).
