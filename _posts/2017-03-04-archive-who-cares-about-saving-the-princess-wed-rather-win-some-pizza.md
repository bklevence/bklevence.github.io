This past week at the Village we kept developing our skills and started diving into our Magnetic Maze project. We went through one Soldering iron tip, half a spool of solder, and quite a few markers this week working on our skills. Plenty of fingers were singed in the process, but <a href="http://makerjawn.org/blog/2013/07/10/camp-begins-at-the-village/#jp-carousel-537">soldering LEDs into pairs </a>is still a hit(led by Sameer &amp; Jacob)!

This was a perfect start for us to begin playing with our Square Force Resistors and the Makey Makey for our <a title="Flash Flash Revolution" href="http://www.flashflashrevolution.com/">FFR</a> dance pad. Although our second iteration looked like it was going to work, we are still having many issues with materiality and time delays. This physical making exploration allowed us to begin working digitally in Scratch (with classes led by Josh, an Animation major from Art Institute also working in the Hot Spot) some sketches that can be found on <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/users/thevillage/">the Villages scratch account</a>!

All of this is leading towards our development of Maze Games that will be a mix of physical Squishy Circuitry and digital Scratch interfaces or games. We took a look at all the different types of mazes and puzzles out there (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12E9X-iAOtT5rK0RLougrN2nnWsYgLkyMeHz-eRHV-HU/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000">here is the presentation we went though</a>) and talked our own experiences in corn mazes. Which started the generation and discussion of different game concepts, mechanics, and our hatred of <a href="http://makerjawn.org/blog/2013/07/17/who-cares-about-saving-the-princess-wed-rather-win-some-pizza/i.imgur.com/V6CAMsO.jpg">helpless princesses in pink-dresses</a>. Personally I can’t wait to see what direction everyone goes in making their own maze games, at the moment “<em>The Legend of Grandmom 2, with Grandpop”</em> is a running favorite.
