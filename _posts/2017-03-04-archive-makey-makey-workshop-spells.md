Last Wednesday I held a <a href="http://www.makeymakey.com/">Makey Makey </a>workshop at <a href="http://phillyspells.org/">Spells Writing Lab</a>. Our game controller workshop was icing on the cake for their work story boarding and creating their own games in <a href="http://gamestarmechanic.com/">Gamestar Mechanic</a>. It was wild to come in and see the variety of different games based off of the same platform.
As this was my first big workshop I was a tad bit nervous as to how itâ€™s introduction would flow into the working session. To my surprise and delight after briefly explaining how the Makey Makey and its component parts work the kids became very attentive(handing out the alligator clips and the Makey Makeys was helpful). This coupled with a quick demonstration of how a high five could make our <a href="http://www.adamatomic.com/canabalt/">CANABALT</a> player jump created an explosively energetic kickoff to making. Immediately the kids took to group work stations and began gleefully tinkering.

Throughout the workshop we explored many different fruits, candy, and found objects as input for their games. Eventually we looked to other video games and gave a stab at creating more complex controllers.
The most awesome of those controllers were those that brought together a team of three pre-teens and made them physically connect and work as a team to complete a level. This same project along with others spawned a variety of foil wearables to act as Earth. It was an excellent learning experience for all. I just hope one day they use their new akey Makey to spar with their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10151835565733278">space adventure foil swords</a>.
