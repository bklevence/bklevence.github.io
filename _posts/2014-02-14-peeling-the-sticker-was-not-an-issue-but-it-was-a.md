<p>Peeling the sticker was not an issue, but it was a bit difficult for the kids to keep it together in the transition and peel back the excess. &frac12; of the cuts were successfully transferred with heavy assistance from mentors(Alexis and myself). (more to come on potential fixes)</p>
<p>This tells me that multiples of cut circuits and components will need to be given to mentors that deploy the project. On top of this I realized that introducing more components than are necessary leads to play <a href="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3817/12524886155_3e0fed9ff1_b.jpg" title="Unneeded resistor on floor etc">and loss</a>. This is pretty good because it gets the kids more used to being around the tools and components, but I need to note that keeping only a few components out on the table makes the process easier. </p>
