***Autumn'24 Update***

It's been a busy 2024 so far. Let's outline what I've been up to:  

- I've been fully stay at home since Helen went back to work at the beginning of the year. Eugene is now 13 months old! Just at the cusp of walking and now screaming a lot, words are hopefully on the horizon. 
- I've mainly just been keeping home and helping friends with small projects as they arrise. I'm slowly starting to look on the horizon at what jobs may be out there for me.
- We went to Europe for about a month this summer. Scotland and Warsaw each for a week and then Provence for 2 weeks. It was amazing seeing friends and family, and we hope to go again as soon as feasible. 
- I just started taking french language classes here in Boston, I got quite good at gracefully failing at using what limited french I know in France. It was amazing, by the end I was able to go to the marche and have brief exchanges to get goods, etc. 
- I'm hoping to get some extra projects documented on here so I can start minimizing my footprint of physical things at home. I have a lot of old electronics parts that should either be used [to finish projects] or dontated.
- This has really been my year of reading, I'm almost at 21 books (including a handfull of mangas). I'm just about to finish the Three Body Problem series as I just picked up Death's End from the library. 
- My favorite book and audiobook that I've found this year is Dungeon Crawler Carl. I've finished the first three books in the series AND listened to the audiobooks. At first I was a little averse to the themes, but then you realise its sarcasam/humour pretty quickly. 
- I'm going to leave this post saying I hope that in the time between now and my next update I'm able to get either a regular Starfinder or some sort of TTRPG game going.
