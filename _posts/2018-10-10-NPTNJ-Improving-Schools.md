I believe public schools can be improved by allowing students creative agency in personal projects. Looking back on my time as a student as well as my current professional experience we learn the most when we are allowed to run on our own with tools and a medium. When students can independently develop a small project to test their skills and learn new ways of working. To summarize I believe there is a place for your traditional lecture, I also think creating a design studio practice works within the classroom, and public schools can benefit greatly from a small scale project based learning.
