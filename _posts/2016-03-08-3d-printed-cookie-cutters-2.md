Here a a couple interesting 3D projects I've helped bring to life. For my thoughts on 3D printing,<a href="http://www.slj.com/2015/05/technology/3-d-printing-worth-the-hype-the-maker-issue/#_"> check out this interview</a> and <a href="http://makerjawn.org/blog/2015/04/10/open-letter-to-librarians-on-3d-printing/">this blog post</a>!

<strong>3D Printed Cookie Cutter Library:</strong>

At the Lilian Marrero library branch we got interested in baking thanks to a few cooking classes.

Take a look at some of the different designs! <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/designer/hackyourworld/lists/cookie-cutter-editor">Proceeds from the Shapeways shop</a> have gone back to filament cost to maintain the library.

<strong>Play-Doh Fun Factor Inserts: </strong>

A simple iterative project we tested what it would take to create a successful Play-Doh press insert with our 3D printer. We measured and tested different sizes of inserts to find what worked best with regards to complexity, tolerance, and structural integrity.
