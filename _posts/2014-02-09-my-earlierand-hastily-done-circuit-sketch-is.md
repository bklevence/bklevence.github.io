<p><span>My earlier(and hastily done) circuit sketch is leading me to consider focusing on simplified units(K.I.S.S) to deploy as my first iteration. These simple versions will only have one of the following inputs: space bar, w, a, s, d, arrow keys. It will be an initial attempt to keep the cost low as I source another microcontroller to make the unit more integrated and simplified while adding more features.</span></p>
