<p><em>I forked Flip’s <a href="http://blog.flipwork.nl/?x=entry:entry100224-003937">4-key-keyboard</a> to begin the second iteration.</em></p>
<p>This evening I took the dive into compiling my own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX">.HEX</a> files. The process of compiling allows code written in C converted into machine code allowing it to be loaded and read by the microcontroller(ATtiny85). I was able to successfully compile two different versions of the code which would allow me to have multiple inputs(keys) into the computer.</p>
<p>A thought occurred to me, so far I have only been working with one key input . This has allowed for my circuit to remain simple as there is only the need for one “sensing input”. I am worried that if I add multiple inputs without moving onto another microcontroller I will undoubtedly make the circuit far more complex.</p>
