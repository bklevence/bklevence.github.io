title: "Raspberry Scones"
---

Served with creme fraiche and lemon curd at the cafe. 

## Ingredients

* 2 cups (260 grams) all purpose flour
* 1/3 cup (65 grams) granulated white sugar
* 1 teaspoon (4 grams) baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon (2 grams) baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon (2 grams) salt
* 6 tablespoons (85 grams) cold unsalted butter, cut into small chunks
* 3/4 cup (180 ml) fresh or frozen raspberries
* 2/3 - 3/4 cup (160 - 180 ml/grams) buttermilk
* 1 teaspoon (4 grams) pure vanilla extract

## Instructions

Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and place rack in middle of oven. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and blend into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or two knives. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs.  Stir in the raspberries. In a small measuring cup whisk together the buttermilk with the vanilla extract. Add this mixture to the flour mixture and stir just until the dough comes together. Do not over mix.

Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead the dough gently four or five times and then pat, or roll, the dough into a circle that is about 7 inches (18 cm) round. Cut the dough into eight triangles. Place the scones on the baking sheet. Brush the tops of the scones with a little cream and sprinkle with granulated white sugar.

Bake for about 18 to 20 minutes or until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the middle of a scone comes out clean. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack.

Makes 8 scones. I am pretty sure we took this from Joy of Baking website.
