title: "Fried Green Tomatoes"
---

I grew up with my neighbors making these. 

## Ingredients

* 2 green tomatoes (fresh/firm are best)
* 3 eggs (beaten)
* 1 c. flour 
* 1 c. breadcrumbs
* 2 Tbsp. sazon seasoning

* Vegetable Oil

## Instructions

1. Slice green tomatoes into 1/4 inch slices
2. Place in microwave and cook roughly 30 seconds on high to soften slightly.
3. Mix breadcrumbs, flour, and sazon packet in bowl
4. Beat eggs in another large bowl
5. Using a fork dredge slices in egg then crumb/flour mix. 
6. Let rest on plate, double dredge for a sturdier fry-up.
7. Heat up oil in pan to either pan fry or deep fry. 
8. Cook until browned, or until fork tender(but not too much). 

I LOVE MAKING THESE IN THE SUMMER AND EAT THEM ON PLAIN ITALIAN BREAD WITH MAYO.
