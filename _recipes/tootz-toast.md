title: “Toot’z Rye-Toast Special”
---

Baked beans, spam, and brown sugar. 😅  

## Ingredients

* 1 can SPAM
* 1 can baked beans
* 1 stick of butter
* 1/3 cup of brown sugar
* 1/2 loaf of rye bread

## Ingredients

1. Toast slices of rye.
2. Butter slices on one side.
3. Place slices in casserole dish or baking tray.
4. Warm up beans in microwave, coat slices with beans.
5. Slice SPAM into 1/8”-1/4” slices, brown/fry on skillet.
6. Place SPAM on top of beans. 
7. Dust with brown sugar, optionally place thin slices of butter on top.
8. Broil until brown sugar is caramelized. 

Serve individual pieces of toast. Ponder how my family survived the depression, WWI, WWII, and the 60’s on a diet like this. Pray for fiber. Think about how many times your Granfather said “righto” on phone calls like a Brit, when he was obviously from NJ, but then realize he spent most of WWII with British soldiers at the age of 30.
