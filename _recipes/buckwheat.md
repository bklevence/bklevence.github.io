title: "Buckwheat Cacao Cookies"

Gluten free!


## Ingredients

* 2 cups buckwheat flour, plus more for surface
* 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 tablespoon baking powder
* 1 1/2 cups (lightly packed) light brown sugar
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
* 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips
* 1 teaspoon strong espresso or strong coffee, room temperature
* Powdered sugar (for sprinkling)
* Sea salt (preferably Maldon; for sprinkling)


## Instructions

* Preheat oven to 375Â° F. 
* Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
* Whisk flour, cocoa powder, and baking powder in a medium bowl; set aside. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat brown sugar and butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Gradually add dry ingredients and beat on medium-low until no dry spots remain. Add chocolate chips and espresso and beat on low speed until just blended.
* Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Shape into a log about 2" in diameter and 10" long. If possible, chill the dough for at least 1 hour before cutting for optimal results.
* After chilling, remove the dough. Cut crosswise into 12 even pieces (they will be large). Place cookies on prepared baking sheet and sprinkle with powdered sugar and a little bit of salt. Bake, rotating once halfway through, until cookies are cracked, slightly puffed, and baked through (they will still be slightly soft and firm up as they cool), 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool slightly on baking sheet, then transfer to a wire rack; cool completely.

## Notes from Pearl:

* I didn't use chocolate chips but cacao nibs instead- they are crunchier and have no added sugar.  I still have Baleinie salt from France and that is what goes on the top.  I used Amish unsalted high fat butter - I think it makes a difference. 

* The dough can be "sandy" and I add a little more coffee to make sure it holds together.  The amount of dough you get is big, so no way, 12 cookies- probably somewhere between 40-50 if you go with the size I sent down. 

* I thought it was interesting the way some of the cookies spread and others did not.  Probably could play with that more.  Either way glad you like them
