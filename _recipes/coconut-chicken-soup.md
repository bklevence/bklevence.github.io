title: "Coconut Chicken Soup"
---

Slow cooker based, most likely Costco rotisserie chicken soup & stock recipes.
When making the soup a trick is to not mix the veggies so the potatoes get more heat than the mushrooms. I like to serve this in our ramen bowls.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 roast or rotisserie chicken, chopped or torn
* Stock from said chicken, see below for recipe
* 1 can coconut milk
* 1 medium pack mushrooms
* 2 medium sized potatoes
* 1 bunch green onions
* 1 bunch cilantro
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 limes
* 1 tablespoon ground fresh chili paste(Sambal Oelek, anything works).
* 1 clove garlic (optional)

## Directions

1. In a low cooker, whisk together chicken stock, chili paste, and coconut milk. Keep on medium or low and stir occasionally to hinder separation.
2. Clean and chop potatoes into 1/4 rectangular pieces, add to pot.
3. Clean and chop mushrooms into quarters, add to pot.
4. Cook until tender.
5. Chop or tear chicken and add to pot.
6. Add water if needed.
7. Let simmer until potatoes are done.
8. Chop green onions and cilantro for garnish, add green onion stems to soup if desired.
9. When potatoes are cooked serve in bowl.
10. Garnish with cilantro, green onion, and a lime wedge.
11. Serve.

## Slow Cooker Chicken Broth

0. Get slow cooker.
1. Add chicken carcass all broken apart, fat, skin, etc.
2. 1/4 an onion or small onion chopped.
3. Fill slow cooker until is about 1/4 full or most of bones are covered. This is a quick stock. So you don't want too much water.
4. Add fork full of vegetable better than bouillon, mix in until dissolved well, or a quart full of frozen vegetable scraps.
5. Add some seasoning, dash of saison, paprika, chili powder, bay leaf, salt and pepper.
6. Let simmer for a while, maybe 4 hours or more.
7. Strain junk, and pour into large bowl, rinse slow cooker for soup.
