"Actually it's very simple. Haha." - Queenie

Best bottled with week old kombucha. I do two or three weeks. I like mine zingy. Bottle it to about 3/4 to the top of the bottle and syrup leaving ample room for gas. All has to be room temp. No hot liquids. Dont kill those good probiotic babies. Check after a week for carbonation, if too sweet wait.
