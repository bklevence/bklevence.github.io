title: "Haluski: Cabbage & Noodles Casserole"

(hah-WOOSS-kee) I've regularly had or made this with sausage or kielbasa. 

## Ingredients

* 1 onion (very large and sliced into rounds)
* 8 ounces butter (divided)
* 1 large head cabbage (cut into 1-inch pieces)
* Salt (to taste)
* Freshly ground black pepper (to taste)
* 2 tablespoons water (if necessary)
* 8 ounces egg noodles (1/2 inch wide, cooked)

## Instructions

1. Gather the ingredients.
2. Cut the round onion slices in half and then in half again so each round yields 4 pieces.
3. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, sauté the onion in 4 ounces of butter, stirring frequently over low heat, until very lightly caramelized. This could take 15 minutes or more.
4. Add the 1-inch cabbage pieces and remaining 4 ounces butter, salt, and pepper to taste, and 2 tablespoons of water, if necessary.
5. Do not cover. Sauté slowly, stirring frequently over low heat, until the cabbage is tender but not brown (cook to al dente stage if baking in the oven). This could take 30 minutes or more.

 
## Stovetop Method

* If using the stovetop method, combine the onion-cabbage mixture with 8 ounces cooked noodles, mixing well. Adjust seasonings and serve.

## Oven Method

* Preheat the oven to 350 F. Butter a large gratin pan and turn the mixture, including the cooked egg noodles, into it.
* Bake uncovered 30 minutes or until the top is lightly browned.
