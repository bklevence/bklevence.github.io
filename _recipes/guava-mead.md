title: "Guava Mead"
---

The first time I made a Costco Mead that didn't taste like rocket fuel after 2 months. The Guava mead replaces water.

## Ingredients

* 1 gallon glass carboy
* Wine Whip
* 3 lbs organic clover honey (Costco, it was on sale)
* 1 pack guava nectar (Costco)
* 1 packet Lalvin ICV D47 yeast
* 1 tsp yeast nutrient
* 2 tsp yeast energizer


## Directions

1. Pour all honey into carboy.
2. Pour guava until 3/4 full.
3. Mix.
4. Add, yeast packet, nutrient, and energizer.
5. Mix.
6. Watch for vigorous fermentation and overflow. (first 12-48 hours)
7. Let sit until fermentation slows. (Month 1)
8. Rack off of pulp bed into secondary.
9. Bottle condition. (Month 1.5-2)

## Serve

1. Chill and pour into stemless wine glass.
2. Consume sooner and store in cool space to slow fermentation and sweetness.

## Questions

* Can I strain the pulp out? I don't think it's worth it.
* What happens if I keep it at warmer temps fermenting for 3 months? I feel like it could ferment longer.
* What is my ABV, I haven't done a gravity reading at mixing, my guess is use the hydrometer?
