title: "Maple Date Scones"
---

These were simple and delicious at the cafe. 

## INGREDIENTS

* 3/4 cup well-shaken buttermilk
* 1/4 cup pure maple syrup
* 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons heavy cream
* 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
* 1/2 lb dried dates, pits discarded and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 1 1/2 cups)
* 2 large egg yolks


## PREPARATION

* Put oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat oven to 400Â°F.
* Whisk together buttermilk, syrup, and 1/2 cup cream in a small bowl. Mix together flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda in bowl of a stand mixer with paddle attachment at low speed (or whisk in a large bowl) until combined. Add butter and mix (or blend with your fingertips or a pastry blender) until mixture resembles coarse meal with some small (roughly pea-size) butter lumps. Mix in figs, then add buttermilk mixture and mix until just combined. (Do not overmix.)
* Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper and drop 10 (1/4-cup) mounds of batter onto each sheet, leaving 1 inch between mounds.
* Whisk together yolks and remaining 2 tablespoons cream, then brush over tops of scones (use all of egg wash).
* Bake, switching position of baking sheets halfway through baking, until scones are puffed and golden, 20 to 25 minutes total.
* Transfer to a rack and cool to warm.

## Cooks' note:

* Scones are best eaten the day they're made.
* halve the sugar and double the maple syrup.
* for an extra special treat serve with a maple glaze icing.
* from gourmet fig scone recipe.
