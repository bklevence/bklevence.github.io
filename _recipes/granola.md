## Notes  
Priscilla pretty much used the ingredients listed in **column 1**. She substituted **coconut flour** for soy flour (couldn’t find soy). For the dried fruit she used apricots, mango, blueberries, cherries, and craisins and ended up baking it **much longer than 30 minutes**, stirring every **10 minutes** for even browning.
