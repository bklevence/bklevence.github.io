title: "Roasted Stuffed Delacata"
---

Originally done with pork, now impossible meat. 

## Ingredients

* 3 Delacata Squash

* 1 Pack of Impossible Meat or Ground Pork
* 2 Apples Peeled and Cubed
* 1 Dried Cranberries, large handful
* 1 Onion
* 1 TBS Mushroom Powder
* 1 TBS Nutritional Yeast
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 2 pieces stale bread or cornbread
* Gravy of choice

## Instructions

* Bake delicata in half for 30min face down on oiled tray. 
* Cook down onions until golden brown w/ butter and olive oil
* Take out let cool 5-10. 
* Make stuffing mix: impossible meat package, two apples peeled and cubed, a solid handful of dried cranberries, cooked onions, 3 cloves of garlic, mushroom powder, nutritional yeast, lightly salted. In my older recipies I think I'd add bread to make it more of a stuffing, because this was missing something. Serve with mushroom gravy if you want.
